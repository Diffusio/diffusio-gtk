Version 2, June 1991

51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the library GPL. It is numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any other libraries whose authors decide to use it. You can use it for your libraries, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link a program with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free library. If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect transforming the program into proprietary software. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs. This license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries. This license is quite different from the ordinary one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is the same as in the ordinary license.

The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a program and simply using it. Linking a program with a library, without changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is analogous to running a utility program or application program. However, in a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License treats it as such.

Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries. We concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.

However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the libraries themselves. This Library General Public License is intended to permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free libraries that are incorporated in them. (We have not seen how to achieve this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards changes in the actual functions of the Library.) The hope is that this will lead to faster development of free libraries.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only works together with the library.

Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary General Public License rather than by this special one.

GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

This License Agreement applies to any software library which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library General Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".

A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)

"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.

You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
The modified work must itself be a software library.
You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.
(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.

You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.

You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.
If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.

Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)

Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.

Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.

When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.

We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.

For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.

Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").

A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.

But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.

Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.

You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.
If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.

Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)

Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:

Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)
Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.
If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.
Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.

You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.
Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.
Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
NO WARRANTY

BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License).

To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

<one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>

This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Lesser General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

<signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990

Ty Coon, President of Vice

That's all there is to it!

Qt COMMERCIAL LICENSE AGREEMENT
Agreement version 3.5

IMPORTANT-READ CAREFULLY: 

1. This Qt Commercial License Agreement ("Agreement") is a legal
agreement between between you (either an individual or a legal entity)
("Licensee") and Trolltech ASA ("Trolltech") for the Trolltech software
product(s) accompanying this Agreement, which include(s) computer
software and may include "online" or electronic documentation,
associated media, and printed materials, including the source code,
example programs and the documentation ("Licensed Software"). 

2. The Licensed Software is protected by copyright laws and
international copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual property
laws and treaties. The Licensed Software is licensed, not sold. 

3. Some of the files in the Licensed Software have been grouped into
Modules. These files contain specific notices defining the Module of
which they are a part. The Modules licensed to Licensee are specified in
the license certificate ("License Certificate") accompanying the
Licensed Software. The terms of the License Certificate are considered
part of the Agreement. In the event of inconsistency or conflict between
the language of this Agreement and the License Certificate, the
provisions of this Agreement shall govern. 

4. By installing, copying, or otherwise using the Licensed Software,
Licensee agrees to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. If Licensee
does not agree to the terms of this Agreement, Licensee may not install,
copy, or otherwise use the Licensed Software. Licensee may, however,
return it to Licensee's place of purchase within 14 days of purchase for
a full refund. In addition, by installing, copying, or otherwise using
any updates or other components of the Licensed Software that Licensee
receives separately as part of the Licensed Software ("Updates"),
Licensee agrees to be bound by any additional license terms that
accompany such Updates, if any. If Licensee does not agree to the
additional license terms that accompany such Updates, Licensee may not
install, copy, or otherwise use such Updates. 

5. Upon Licensee's acceptance of the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, Trolltech grants Licensee the right to use the Licensed
Software in the manner provided below. 

6. Trolltech grants to Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable,
perpetual license to make, use and modify copies of the Licensed
Software for the maximum number of named individuals within Licensee's
organization ("Named User"(s)) specified in the License Certificate for
the sole purposes of designing, developing, and testing Licensee's
software product(s), which may include the Licensed Software
("Application(s)"). Modified Licensed Software shall be considered as
Licensed Software for the purposes of this Agreement. 

7. Licensee may install copies of the Licensed Software on an unlimited
number of computers provided that only the Named Users use the Licensed
Software. Licensee may at any time designate another Named User within
Licensee's organization to replace a then-current Named User by
notifying Trolltech, provided that a) the then-current Named User has
not been designated as a replacement during the last six (6) months; and
b) there is no more than the specified number of Named Users at any
given time. 

8. Verification: Trolltech or a certified auditor on Trolltech's behalf,
may, upon its reasonable request and at its expense, audit Licensee with
respect to the use of the Licensed Software. Such audit may be conducted
by mail, electronic means or through an in-person visit to Licensee's
place of business. Any such in-person audit shall be conducted during
regular business hours at Licensee's facilities and shall not
unreasonably interfere with Licensee's business activities. Trolltech
will not remove, copy, or redistribute any electronic material during
the course of an audit. Licensee does not implicitly grant Trolltech any
form of license agreement. If an audit reveals that Licensee is using
the Licensed Software in a way that is in material violation of the
terms of the Agreement, then Licensee shall pay Trolltech's reasonable
costs of conducting the audit. In the case of a material violation,
Licensee agrees to pay Trolltech any amounts owing that are attributable
to the unauthorized use. In the alternative, Trolltech reserves the
right, at Trolltech's sole option, to terminate the licenses for the
Licensed Software. 

9. The Licensed Software may provide links to third party libraries or
code (collectively "Third Party Libraries") to implement various
functions. Third Party Libraries do not comprise part of the Licensed
Software. In some cases, access to Third Party Libraries may be included
along with the Licensed Software delivery as a convenience for
development and testing only. Such source code and libraries as are or
may be listed in the ".../src/3rdparty" source tree delivered with the
Licensed Software or documented in the Licensed Software where the Third
Party Libraries are used, as may be amended from time to time, do not
comprise the Licensed Software. Licensee acknowledges (1) that some
Third Party Libraries may require additional licensing of copyright and
patents from the owners of such, and (2) that distribution of any of the
Licensed Software referencing any portion of a Third Party Library may
require appropriate licensing from such third parties. 

GENERAL TERMS THAT APPLY TO APPLICATIONS AND REDISTRIBUTABLES 
10. a) Trolltech grants Licensee a non-exclusive, royalty-free right to
reproduce and distribute the object code form of certain portions of the
Licensed Software ("Redistributables"), as specified in Appendix 1,
Section 1, for execution on any operating system of a type listed in the
License Certificate ("Platforms"). Copies of Redistributables may only
be distributed with and for the sole purpose of executing Applications
permitted under this Agreement that Licensee has created using the
Licensed Software. Under no circumstances may any copies of
Redistributables be distributed separately. This Agreement does not give
Licensee any rights to distribute any of the parts of the Licensed
Software listed in Appendix 1, Section 2, neither as a whole nor as
parts or snippets of code. 

b) Licensee may not distribute, transfer, assign or otherwise dispose of
Applications and/or Redistributables, in binary/compiled form, or in any
other form, if such action is part of a joint software and hardware
distribution, except as provided by a separate runtime distribution
license with Trolltech or one of its authorized distributors. A joint
hardware and software distribution shall be defined as either: (i)
distribution of a hardware device where, in its final end user
configuration, the main user interface of the device is provided by
Application(s) created by Licensee or others, using a commercial version
of a Trolltech product, and depends on the Licensed Software or an open
source version of any Trolltech software product; or (ii) distribution
of the Licensed Software onto a device designed to facilitate the
installation of the Licensed Software onto the same device where the
main user interface of such device is provided by Applicaton(s) created
by Licensee or others, using a commercial version of a Trolltech
product, and depends on the Licensed Software. 

11. The license granted in this Agreement for Licensee to create
Applications and distribute them and the Redistributables (if any) to
Licensee's customers is subject to all of the following conditions: (i)
all copies of the Applications Licensee creates must bear a valid
copyright notice, either Licensee's own or the copyright notice that
appears on the Licensed Software; (ii) Licensee may not remove or alter
any copyright, trademark or other proprietary rights notice contained in
any portion of the Licensed Software, including but not limited to the
About Boxes in "Qt Assistant" and "Qt Linguist" as defined in Appendix
1; (iii) Redistributables, if any, shall be licensed to Licensee's
customer "as is"; (iv) Licensee will indemnify and hold Trolltech, its
related companies and its suppliers, harmless from and against any
claims or liabilities arising out of the use, reproduction or
distribution of Applications; (v) Applications must be developed using a
licensed, registered copy of the Licensed Software; (vi) Applications
must add primary and substantial functionality to the Licensed Software;
(vii) Applications may not pass on functionality which in any way makes
it possible for others to create software with the Licensed Software,
however Licensee may use the Licensed Software's scripting functionality
solely in order to enable scripting that augments the functionality of
the Application(s) without adding primary and substantial functionality
to the Application(s); (viii) Applications may not compete with the
Licensed Software; (ix) Licensee may not use Trolltech's or any of its
suppliers' names, logos, or trademarks to market Application(s), except
to state that Application was developed using the Licensed Software. 

NOTE: The Open Source Editions of Trolltech's products are licensed
under the terms of the GPL and not under this Agreement. If Licensee
has, at any time, developed all (or any portions of) the Application(s)
using an Open Source Edition of a Trolltech product, Licensee must
comply with Trolltech's requirements (see
http://trolltech.com/downloads/opensource) and license such
Application(s) (or any portions derived there from) under the terms of
the Free Software Foundation's GNU General Public License version 2 or
version 3 (the "GPL") a copy of which is located at
http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/info/GPLv2.html and
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html (i.e., any Product(s) and/or parts,
components, portions thereof developed using GPL licensed software,
including an Open Source Edition of a Trolltech product, must be
licensed under the terms of the GPL, and the GPL-based source code must
be made available upon request). 

12. Warranty Disclaimer: The Licensed Software is licensed to Licensee
"as is". To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Trolltech on
behalf of itself and its suppliers, disclaims all warranties and
conditions, either express or implied, including, but not limited to,
implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose,
title and non-infringement with regard to the Licensed Software. 

13. Limitation of Liability: If, Trolltech's warranty disclaimer
notwithstanding, Trolltech is held liable to Licensee, whether in
contract, tort or any other legal theory, based on the Licensed
Software, Trolltech's entire liability to Licensee and Licensee's
exclusive remedy shall be, at Trolltech's option, either (A) return of
the price Licensee paid for the Licensed Software, or (B) repair or
replacement of the Licensed Software, provided Licensee returns to
Trolltech all copies of the Licensed Software as originally delivered to
Licensee. Trolltech shall not under any circumstances be liable to
Licensee based on failure of the Licensed Software if the failure
resulted from accident, abuse or misapplication, nor shall Trolltech
under any circumstances be liable for special damages, punitive or
exemplary damages, damages for loss of profits or interruption of
business or for loss or corruption of data. Any award of damages from
Trolltech to Licensee shall not exceed the total amount Licensee has
paid to Trolltech in connection with this Agreement. 

14. Support and Updates: Licensee will be eligible to receive email
based software developer support and access to Updates to the Licensed
Software ("Support and Updates") for a period not to exceed one year
from the date of initial delivery ("Initial Term"), in accordance with
Trolltech's then current policies and procedures, if any. Such policies
and procedures may be changed from time to time. Following the Initial
Term, Trolltech will no longer make the Licensed Software available to
Licensee unless Licensee purchases additional Support and Updates
according to section 15 below. 

15. Renewal of Support and Updates: Licensee may purchase additional
Support and Updates following the Initial Term at Trolltech's terms and
conditions applicable at the time of renewal. 

GENERAL PROVISIONS
16. Marketing: Trolltech may include Licensee's company name and logo in
a publicly available list of Trolltech customers. 

17. No Assignment: Neither this Agreement nor Licensee's rights under
this Agreement are assignable or transferable by Licensee either in
whole or in part to any third party without Trolltech's written consent.
Any attempted assignment or transfer in violation of the foregoing shall
be void. Trolltech may assign or transfer this Agreement to any third
party who acquires substantially all of Trolltech copyrights in and to
the Licensed Software. 

18. Termination: Trolltech may terminate the Agreement at any time
immediately upon written notice by Trolltech to Licensee if Licensee
breaches this Agreement, fails to pay the fees for the Licensed
Software, or infringes Trolltech's intellectual property in or to the
Licensed Software. Upon termination of the Licenses, Licensee shall
return to Trolltech all copies of Licensed Software that were supplied
by Trolltech. All other copies of Licensed Software in the possession or
control of Licensee must be erased or destroyed. An officer of Licensee
must promptly deliver to Trolltech a written confirmation that this has
occurred. 

19. Clauses that survive termination: Sections 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, 20, 21
and 22 shall survive the termination of this Agreement, however Sections
6 and 7 shall not survive if the Agreement is terminated for cause. 

20. Entire Agreement: This Agreement constitutes the complete agreement
between the parties and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous
discussions, representations, and proposals, written or oral, with
respect to the subject matters discussed herein. No modification of this
Agreement will be effective unless contained in a writing executed by an
authorized representative of each party. No term or condition contained
in Licensee's purchase order will apply unless expressly accepted by
Trolltech in writing. If any provision of the Agreement is found void or
unenforceable, the remainder will remain valid and enforceable according
to its terms. If any remedy provided is determined to have failed for
its essential purpose, all limitations of liability and exclusions of
damages set forth in this Agreement shall remain in effect. 

21. Confidentiality: Each party acknowledges that during the Initial
Term of this Agreement it will have access to information about the
other party's business, business methods, business plans, customers,
business relations, technology, and other information, including the
terms of this Agreement, that is confidential and of great value to the
other party, and the value of which would be significantly reduced if
disclosed to third parties (the "Confidential Information").
Accordingly, when a party (the "Receiving Party") receives Confidential
Information from another party (the "Disclosing Party"), the Receiving
Party shall, and shall obligate its employees and agents and employees
and agents of its affiliates to: (i) maintain the Confidential
Information in strict confidence; (ii) not disclose the Confidential
Information to a third party without the Disclosing Party's prior
written approval; and (iii) not, directly or indirectly, use the
Confidential Information for any purpose other than for exercising its
rights and fulfilling its responsibilities pursuant to this Agreement.
Each party shall take reasonable measures to protect the Confidential
Information of the other party, which measures shall not be less than
the measures taken by such party to protect its own confidential and
proprietary information. "Confidential Information" shall not include
information that (a) is or becomes generally known to the public through
no act or omission of the Receiving Party; (b) was in the Receiving
Party's lawful possession prior to the disclosure hereunder and was not
subject to limitations on disclosure or use; (c) is developed by the
Receiving Party or by persons who have not had access to the
Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party; (d) is lawfully
disclosed to the Receiving Party without restrictions, by a third party
not under an obligation of confidentiality; or (e) the Receiving Party
is legally compelled to disclose the information, in which case the
Receiving Party shall assert the privileged and confidential nature of
the information and cooperate fully with the Disclosing Party to protect
against and prevent disclosure of any Confidential Information and to
limit the scope of disclosure and the dissemination of disclosed
Confidential Information by all legally available means. The obligations
of the Receiving Party under this Section shall continue during the Term
and for a period of twelve (12) months after expiration or termination
thereof; provided, however, that with respect to trade secret
information, the obligations of the Receiving Party under this Section
shall continue as long as such information remains a trade secret under
applicable law. 

22.	Governing law, legal venue: This Agreement shall be construed,
interpreted and governed by the laws of Norway, the legal venue to be
Oslo City Court. Trolltech reserves all rights not specifically granted
in this Agreement.
